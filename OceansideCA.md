## Types of Water Damage

Water damage is classified into three categories, each requiring a tailored approach for effective remediation:

- **Clean Water Damage:** Originates from uncontaminated sources, such as broken pipes or rainwater. While it poses minimal health risks, prompt action is still necessary.
- **Gray Water Damage:** Involves water from appliances like dishwashers or washing machines. This type may contain contaminants that can lead to health issues if not addressed quickly.
- **Black Water Damage:** Highly contaminated water from sewage or floodwaters, presenting serious health risks. Immediate professional intervention is essential.

When faced with water intrusion, swift action can significantly reduce damage. Here are the recommended steps:

1. **Stop the Water Source:** If safe, turn off the water supply to prevent further flooding.
