## Types of Water Damage

Water damage is classified into three categories, each requiring a tailored approach for effective remediation:

- **Clean Water Damage:** Originates from uncontaminated sources, such as broken pipes or rainwater. While it poses minimal health risks, prompt action is still necessary.
- **Gray Water Damage:** Involves water from appliances like dishwashers or washing machines. This type may contain contaminants that can lead to health issues if not addressed quickly.
- **Black Water Damage:** Highly contaminated water from sewage or floodwaters, presenting serious health risks. Immediate professional intervention is essential.

## Immediate Actions to Mitigate Damage

When faced with water intrusion, swift action can significantly reduce damage. Here are the recommended steps:

1. **Stop the Water Source:** If safe, turn off the water supply to prevent further flooding.
2. **Shut Off Electricity:** Ensure safety by turning off electrical systems in affected areas to avoid electrocution hazards.
3. **Document the Damage:** Capture photos and videos of the affected areas for insurance claims and future reference.
4. **Remove Affected Items:** Take out wet carpets, furniture, and personal belongings to facilitate drying and prevent mold growth.
5. **Contact Restoration Professionals:** Reach out to a qualified service provider for expert assistance in managing the situation.
